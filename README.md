# arduinomaze

# SE 101 Project Proposal

Group members: Siyuan Wang, Tej partap Singh  
# Objective:
1. Build a circuit that connects Arduino and an LCD
2. Create a maze game on Arduino and show graphics on an LCD
3. The Player can interact with the game by clicking multiple buttons
Software components:
1. The codes that support the logic behind the interface
2. The game scene rendered on LCD
3. The interactive functions called by the buttons
# Prototype plan:
1. We will be following an Evolutionary prototype approach. A prototype with minimal
functionality will be made and after initial testing and feedbacks new functionality and
improvements will be added.
2. The prototype we develop will be a horizontal prototype as it will provide a broad view
focusing on user interactions. While this will not be a complete game but it will still
amazingly show how something that once required a full PC is now possible on an Arduino
microcontroller.
Hardware acquired:
1. Arduino UNO
2. Arduino kit
3. Nokia 5110 LCD
Challenges:
1. Build feasible circuits with the least electronic components
2. Create clear UI for the LCD screen so the players could understand
3. Code with clear logic so everyone could understand right away
